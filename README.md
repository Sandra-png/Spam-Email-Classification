Assignment 1: Spam Email Classification using Supervised Learning, followed by Feature Engineering

You will apply the knowledge of machine learning algorithms to analyze features extracted from email datasets and build a robust model capable of distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails. Perform feature engineering and choose appropriate supervised learning classification algorithms for spam detection, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forests. You need to split the dataset into training and testing sets, and train the selected models on the training data. Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Use confusion matrices to gain insights into false positives and false negatives.
